<p><a href="sameFolderPage.html" target="_self">Opens the linked document in the same window/tab as it was clicked (this is default)</a></p>


<p> Try this <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_links_target_top">example of _top target</a>. Maybe
you won't see any effect. However, remove "target=_top" attribute and try again. You will see what happens. This is due to
<i>frames</i>, something that we will see. They were very used in the past, but not in nowadays.</p>
